    "The Fst looks high between pop 2 (2009) and the other pops (2005, 2010, 2014, and 2015), but that's likely all driven by the small sample size for that population. The other pairwise comparisons seem pretty minor. It'd be interesting to look at outlier loci next, which may show a larger signal."
