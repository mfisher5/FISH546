    "## STACKS+BOWTIE+BLAST Pipeline for Population Genomics Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the full pipeline that I'm using to analyze my Pacific cod time series data, and I'm hoping to be able to use on future projects as well. Our lab uses the Stacks pipeline, followed by filtering our catalog with Bowtie and BLAST to filter down our catalog of loci into a de novo reference genome. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of my current concerns is that there are a couple of individual fish that Isadora sequenced twice, and I can't remember why, but I think she was testing some sort of method (like extraction, or shearing cycle number, etc.). The first time I ran through my pipeline I don't think I properly named the files, and I think I left one of them behind. So before I'm completely done with this data set (after FISH 546) I should go back and make sure I have things named right so I can show the data to Isadora.\n",
